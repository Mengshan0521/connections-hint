## What is Connections?
Connections is from The New York Times, and it's seriously so fun and addictive. Shoutout to Wyna Liu, one of the associate puzzle editors, for helping bring this gem to their Games section!

Here's how it works: every day, there's a new puzzle with 16 words, and the goal is to group these words into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like book titles, software, country names, you name it. But be careful—there’s only one correct way to group them, even if multiple words seem like they fit together. 

If you get a set right, those words disappear from the board. But if you guess wrong, it counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. The best part is that you can shuffle the board to help spot connections more easily, which is a total lifesaver sometimes!

Each group is color-coded based on difficulty: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like with Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media, which makes it even more fun.

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, so it's super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you'll be hooked! Happy puzzling!

🌸 It's July 16, 2024, and I’m so pumped to dive into today’s NYT Connections game with you all! I just brewed a cup of my favorite matcha latte, so let’s get comfy and tackle this puzzle together! ☕✨

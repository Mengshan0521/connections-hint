## What is Connections?

Connections is from The New York Times, and it's seriously so fun and addictive. Shoutout to Wyna Liu, one of the associate puzzle editors, for helping bring this gem to their Games section!

Here's how it works: every day, there's a new puzzle with 16 words, and the goal is to group these words into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like book titles, software, country names, you name it. But be careful‚Äîthere‚Äôs only one correct way to group them, even if multiple words seem like they fit together.

If you get a set right, those words disappear from the board. But if you guess wrong, it counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. The best part is that you can shuffle the board to help spot connections more easily, which is a total lifesaver sometimes!

Each group is color-coded based on difficulty: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like with Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media, which makes it even more fun.

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, so it's super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you'll be hooked! Happy puzzling!

Hey everyone! It‚Äôs July 29, 2024, and I‚Äôm back with another fun and challenging NYT Connections puzzle! ‚òÄÔ∏è Grab your favorite drink, and let‚Äôs solve today‚Äôs puzzle together! ‚òïüß©

Today's Connections puzzle was a total blast! üéâ I love how it makes you think outside the box. So, this morning, I decided to tackle the puzzle with my bestie over a video call. We've turned this into our little ritual, and it's always a great way to start the day. ‚òÄÔ∏è

The **STADIUMS** category was a slam dunk for us! üèÄ The second I saw **ARENA** and **COLISEUM**, I knew we were onto something. It's amazing how many words you can connect once you find the first link.

**STREET SUFFIXES** was another fun one. It reminded me of my daily runs around the neighborhood. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Who knew **ALLEY** and **COURT** could be so interesting when you‚Äôre not trying to avoid tripping on a sidewalk crack?

Now, the **ASSOCIATED WITH SCALES** group was a bit tricky at first. **LIBRA** and **JUSTICE** clicked because of the whole balance thing, but **SOLFEGE** threw us off. Had to dig deep into those music class memories! üé∂

Lastly, **THINGS WITH SPOUTS** had us giggling. Imagining a **TEAPOT** and a **WHALE** together is just adorable. üêã‚òï I almost poured myself another cup of tea while figuring that one out.

We had such a laugh trying to fit **GUTTER** into different groups before we realized it spouts water too! üòÇ

So, if you‚Äôre stuck, don‚Äôt hesitate to hit that shuffle button. It really helps to see the words in a new order. And remember, solving these puzzles is all about having fun and keeping your brain sharp. You've got this! üí™ü§ì

Until next time, happy puzzling! üß©‚ú®

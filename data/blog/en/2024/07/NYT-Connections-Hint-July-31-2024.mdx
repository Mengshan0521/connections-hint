## What is Connections?

Connections is from The New York Times, and it's seriously so fun and addictive. Shoutout to Wyna Liu, one of the associate puzzle editors, for helping bring this gem to their Games section!

Here's how it works: every day, there's a new puzzle with 16 words, and the goal is to group these words into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like book titles, software, country names, you name it. But be careful—there’s only one correct way to group them, even if multiple words seem like they fit together.

If you get a set right, those words disappear from the board. But if you guess wrong, it counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. The best part is that you can shuffle the board to help spot connections more easily, which is a total lifesaver sometimes!

Each group is color-coded based on difficulty: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like with Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media, which makes it even more fun.

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, so it's super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you'll be hooked! Happy puzzling!

Today's Connections puzzle was an absolute blast! 🌟 So, I started my day with a fresh cup of coffee and jumped right into it. ☕🧩 

For the **Voice Characteristics** group, I kept hearing different tones in my head (maybe I've been binge-watching too much TV 😅). When I saw **GRUFF** and **HOARSE**, I knew I was on the right track. 

The **Digits on Your Hand** group was pretty fun too! 💅 As soon as I saw **LITTLE** and **MIDDLE**, I remembered all those times I painted my nails. 

Now, the **Types of Beer** group got me thinking about my favorite craft beer pub downtown. 🍻 I could almost taste the **STOUT** and **PORTER** just by looking at the words. 

Finally, **French Connections** took me back to my high school French class. 🥖🇫🇷 I giggled at **FRENCH KISS** (such a classic!) and remembered my friend's adorable **FRENCH BULLDOG**. 

Speaking of France, did you catch the Olympics opening ceremony in Paris? 🎉 It was such a spectacle, but honestly, it felt a bit off from the true Olympic spirit. The whole thing was more like a grand fashion show with extravagant performances. Not to mention, there were quite a few hiccups. They messed up the South Korean flag multiple times, which was pretty embarrassing. 😬 And from what I heard, the athletes weren't too thrilled about the food—they definitely deserve better fuel for their incredible performances! 🍴🏅

If you're stuck, remember to shuffle those words around. It makes a world of difference seeing them in a new order. And don't stress too much—it's all about having fun and keeping your brain sharp. You've got this! 💪🤓

Until next time, happy puzzling! 🧩✨

## What is Connections?

Connections is from The New York Times, and it's seriously so fun and addictive. Shoutout to Wyna Liu, one of the associate puzzle editors, for helping bring this gem to their Games section!

Here's how it works: every day, there's a new puzzle with 16 words, and the goal is to group these words into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like book titles, software, country names, you name it. But be careful‚Äîthere‚Äôs only one correct way to group them, even if multiple words seem like they fit together.

If you get a set right, those words disappear from the board. But if you guess wrong, it counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. The best part is that you can shuffle the board to help spot connections more easily, which is a total lifesaver sometimes!

Each group is color-coded based on difficulty: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like with Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media, which makes it even more fun.

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, so it's super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you'll be hooked! Happy puzzling!

Hey everyone! It‚Äôs July 28, 2024, and I‚Äôm back with another fun and challenging NYT Connections puzzle! ‚òÄÔ∏è Grab your favorite drink, and let‚Äôs solve today‚Äôs puzzle together! ‚òïüß©

Today's Connections puzzle was an absolute rollercoaster! üé¢ It felt like deciphering a mystery novel while sipping a caramel macchiato. ‚òï The **CAT COAT PATTERNS** group was surprisingly relatable, as my cat Oreo is a TUXEDO cat, strutting around the house like he owns the place. üê±‚ú®

Let's talk about **NERVOUSNESS, IN THE SINGULAR**. Have you ever had those **BUTTERFLY** feelings before a big presentation or meeting someone new? That's me every Monday morning! ü¶ãüòÖ I guess the puzzle creators knew exactly what they were doing to keep us on our toes.

The **STARTING WITH VEGETABLES** group was a real head-scratcher! Who knew BEETHOVEN could hang out with a PEACOCK in a CORNUCOPIA? üé∂ü¶ö But it all makes sense in the whimsical world of Connections!

I was almost fooled by the **PARTS OF A BOOK** group. At first, I thought SPINE belonged to a group about the body! üìñ But, nope, it had to do with my love for reading (and sometimes judging books by their COVERS). üòú

I spent a chill Sunday morning tackling this puzzle with my best friend over FaceTime. We had a good laugh at how we got stuck on the **STARTING WITH VEGETABLES** group, trying to figure out the hidden meaning behind it. In the end, the shuffle button saved the day again! üòÇüôå

As always, take breaks and keep your brain refreshed when doing these puzzles. Don't hesitate to hit that shuffle button to get a fresh perspective on the words. Remember, you got this! üí™ü§ì

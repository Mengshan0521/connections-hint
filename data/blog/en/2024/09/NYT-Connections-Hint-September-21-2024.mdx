## Hey there, puzzle peeps! 🧩

It’s September 21, 2024, and today’s *NYT Connections* game got me diving into some mystical, psychic vibes 🧙‍♀️ while also dealing with extreme adjectives like, *whoa*. 😅 Seriously, it was one of those mornings where I’m like, "Am I solving a puzzle or am I joining a séance?!" 🔮✨ Anyway, grab your favorite drink (I’m having my third iced coffee of the day, no shame ☕️), and let’s get into today’s puzzle breakdown.

### Word Explanations 💬

- **REAL**: Not fake! It’s legit, like me keeping it real when I say this puzzle was tricky. 😎
- **MEDIUM**: A psychic medium, or like, halfway between small and large? You decide! 🧘‍♀️
- **IMPRESSIVE**: That’s what people say when you solve this puzzle on your first try. Go you! 👏
- **EXCLUSIVE**: Limited edition, like that cute jacket I splurged on last week. Only the best. 💁‍♀️
- **NICE**: As in, "Hey, you did a *nice* job with this puzzle!" Or like, I’ll take that as a compliment. 😊
- **RARE**: Something super hard to find, like that one clean pair of socks in my laundry pile. 🧦
- **AWFUL**: The opposite of nice, but kinda funny when you over-exaggerate like, "This weather is *awful*!" 😖
- **MYSTIC**: Very "woo-woo" and magical. Are we casting spells yet or what? 🔮✨
- **WAY**: As in, "No *way*!" (when you can’t believe the answer), or like, direction. 🛤️
- **WELL DONE**: What you say when you totally nailed something, like finishing this puzzle without peeking at the hints! 🎉
- **BLOODY**: No, not just for British slang! But I was *bloody* confused by this puzzle at first. 😅
- **LIMITED**: Only a few available, like how many brain cells I have left after this challenge. 🤯
- **ORACLE**: A wise one, or maybe just that friend who always knows all the drama before you do. 📜🧠
- **PROPS**: Shoutout for doing something awesome! Like, "Hey, props to you for solving this!" 🙌
- **COLLECTIBLE**: Something you can’t resist keeping, like all my cute enamel pins! 🎀
- **PSYCHIC**: Can you read my mind? 'Cause I had no clue what the answers were at first! 🧠🔮

### Theme Hints 🔮

1. **Clairvoyant Crew**:  
   - These words give off serious psychic or mystical vibes—think MEDIUM, PSYCHIC, MYSTIC, and ORACLE. 🔮✨

2. **Fancy Adjectives**:  
   - Feeling special yet? Words like COLLECTIBLE, EXCLUSIVE, LIMITED, and RARE are all about things that are a cut above! 💎

3. **"Great Job!" Phrases**:  
   - Words that give you all the compliments. If you ever needed a confidence boost, think IMPRESSIVE, NICE, PROPS, and WELL DONE! 🙌🎉

4. **Very Intense Adjectives**:  
   - This one’s all about extremes! Words like AWFUL, BLOODY, REAL, and WAY are here to make a big deal out of anything. 😱

## What is Connections?

Hey there, beautiful people! 🌼 I am so pumped to share today’s *NYT Connections* game with you all! If you haven’t jumped on the *Connections* bandwagon yet, then seriously, what are you waiting for? 🚂 It’s a word-lover’s dream! Imagine solving a mysterious puzzle with just words—it’s like *The Da Vinci Code* for nerds, but better! 😂 Today’s game was a rollercoaster, and I’m here to break down every little twist and turn for you! 🎢 So, grab a cup of coffee (or maybe tea, no judgment here) and let’s dive in! ☕️

## Word Explanations

- **STARS**: Bright and shiny! Whether it's in the sky or on your favorite celebrity’s profile. 🌟
- **STRIPES**: Think American flags, zebra coats, or those comfy pajamas! 😉
- **HAND**: To give a hand... or maybe the one you use to text all day long! 🤳
- **DELIVER**: Not just for the mailman, but also what I expect from my pizza guy! 🍕
- **SORTS**: Kinds, varieties... however you classify your shoe collection. 👠
- **DECK OF CARDS**: Your go-to for a Friday night with friends or that game of solitaire. ♠️♥️
- **THUMBS**: Opposable, obviously. But also how we judge everything online! 👍👎
- **MONARCHY**: Kings, queens, and all the royal drama! 👑
- **PASS**: What I do when someone offers me a kale smoothie… hard pass! 🥬❌
- **TYPES**: Whether it’s people, fonts, or my dating history… I’ve got a type. 😂
- **NHL**: Ice, pucks, and some serious skate action! 🏒
- **A-F**: Grading scale flashbacks—did you ever get that dreaded “F”? 🙈
- **PERCENTAGE**: 100% ready for the weekend, 0% done with my to-do list. 🙃
- **CHECKERS**: A classic board game or the pattern of your fave flannel shirt! 🖤🟥
- **GIVE**: A lot like sharing, but with extra effort. Or what I hope my Wi-Fi doesn’t do: give out! 😂
- **KINDS**: Different types, like ice cream flavors or moods in a day. 🍦😅

## Theme Hints

1. **VARIETIES**:  
   - These words are all about choices, like picking your mood for the day! 😜  
2. **TRANSFER**:  
   - Passing things around, whether it’s a football or your shift at work! 🏈💼  
3. **RATINGS SYSTEMS**:  
   - You know, the stuff you use to judge your latest Netflix binge. 🍿⭐  
4. **THINGS WITH KINGS**:  
   - A royal lineup of things that make you think of rulers and crowns. 👑

- **VARIETIES**: KINDS, SORTS, STRIPES, TYPES  
   - Oh, the choices we make! Whether you’re looking at different kinds of candy (my weakness 🍭) or sorting out life’s varieties, these words are all about variety and options. It’s like walking into a candy store and trying to pick just one! 🍬😂

- **TRANSFER**: DELIVER, HAND, GIVE, PASS  
   - These are all about moving things from one place to another. Like when I hand my bestie my leftover fries because I’m “on a diet”... but also ask for a bite back. 😂🍟  

- **RATINGS SYSTEMS**: A-F, PERCENTAGE, STARS, THUMBS  
   - Here’s where you think about how we judge everything in life! Whether it’s giving a restaurant 5 stars (like that amazing taco place down the street 🌮) or an A+ on your math test (if only... 😅), these are all ways to rate and grade!   

- **THINGS WITH KINGS**: CHECKERS, DECK OF CARDS, MONARCHY, NHL  
   - From games that feature kings (like checkers and cards) to the monarchy itself, this one was all about things that have kings involved. And of course, the NHL, because who doesn’t love some good ol' hockey royalty on ice? 👑🏒

OMG, today’s game was just TOO much fun! 🤩 The **VARIETIES** group had me thinking of all the different ways I could sort my wardrobe (don’t judge, I’m just trying to live my best organized life! 👗). The **TRANSFER** group had me considering all the ways we “pass it on” in life, like the good vibes and, of course, my fries. 🍟

The **RATINGS SYSTEMS** made me chuckle thinking about how many things I rate on the daily—from my Uber rides to that cute new coffee shop down the block! ☕️ And *don’t* get me started on **THINGS WITH KINGS**. Let’s just say, if there was a crown for most snacks eaten during a puzzle, I’d win it. 👑😂 

I hope this helped clear up today’s puzzle madness! Don’t forget to join me tomorrow for more word magic! ✨ Until then, I’m off to figure out what type of coffee I should have next... maybe a latte? Or should I try that matcha I’ve been hearing about? Decisions, decisions… ☕️💚

Catch ya later, friends! 😘

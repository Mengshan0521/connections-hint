## What’s New in Connections Today?

Hey friends! 🌟 It’s September 15, and you know what that means—time to dive into today’s *NYT Connections*! If you’re like me, you’re probably already hooked on these puzzles. They’re like a morning ritual (aside from that coffee, of course ☕). Let’s break down today’s hints and see if we can crack this puzzle together! 🎉

## Word Explanations

- **DWELL**: Think about where you spend your time—home, office, or maybe your fave coffee shop? It’s all about staying put! 🏡  
- **TURKEY**: Not just the bird on Thanksgiving but also a term for someone who’s a bit of a goof. 🦃  
- **SEA**: Big, blue, and salty—perfect for summer vacations or daydreams of beachside relaxation. 🌊  
- **WONDER**: It’s all about amazement and awe. You know, those “wow” moments when life is just too cool to handle. 🌟  
- **SAP**: This one’s a bit of a stretch—could be about the sticky stuff from trees or someone who’s just not very bright. 🌳  
- **DWINDLE**: When something decreases or fades away. Like your snacks disappearing before you even get a chance to enjoy them. 🍿  
- **STAY**: To remain in one place or keep something as it is. Whether it’s a vacation stay or a promise to stick around. 🏨  
- **DECLINE**: When something drops or becomes less. Not exactly the best news, but hey, it’s all about the ups and downs! 📉  
- **DWEEB**: Another word for someone who’s a bit of a nerd or socially awkward. Embrace your inner geek! 🤓  
- **EBB**: Like the tide—when things go down or recede. It’s the natural flow of things. 🌊  
- **LIVE**: To be alive or to experience something in real-time. Live concerts or just living your best life! 🎤  
- **SIN**: A moral wrongdoing or something you might regret. Just a reminder to be good (or at least try)! 😇  
- **INHABIT**: Where you live or reside. From a cozy apartment to a sprawling mansion, it’s all about living spaces. 🏠  
- **DWARF**: A term for something small or even the mythical beings in fairy tales. Think small stature or fantasy worlds. 🧚  
- **DROP**: To let something fall or to decrease in level. Whether it’s your phone slipping from your hand or a drop in temperature. 🌡️

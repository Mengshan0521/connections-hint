## What is Connections?

Hey besties! 💕 So, my new obsession? *NYT Connections*, duh! You get 16 words, and you’ve got to figure out what sneaky little groups they belong to. It’s the perfect combo of fun and frustration that I just can’t resist! 😜 But don’t worry, I got your back with some hints today—spoiler-free, of course (unless you peek 😏). Ready to flex that brain muscle with me?

## Word Explanations

- **FROST**: Like that final touch on cupcakes. Sweet and sticky! 🧁
- **BEACH**: Sun, sand, waves… and endless sunscreen reapplying! 🏖️🌊
- **PUMP**: Your heart’s jam when you're running late or listening to a fire playlist. 🔥
- **POPE**: He’s basically the biggest name in the church game. 🕊️
- **RACE**: What your heart does when you’re about to miss the bus, am I right?! 🏃‍♀️💨
- **BISHOP**: Another high-up church guy—but not quite pope-level. ⚜️
- **PET SHOP**: Where you go to dream about adopting ALL the fluffy creatures! 🐶🐱
- **POUND**: Either the gym grind 💪 or the drumbeat in your chest when you’re stressed out!
- **HARDY**: You know those teen detective boys always solving mysteries? That’s them! 🕵️‍♂️
- **BEAT**: You can beat eggs, but also life can beat you down sometimes (we got this though!). 🥚💪
- **PRIOR**: Like a monk boss (basically), but not as flashy as the pope. ✝️
- **BAKE**: Mix, bake, and boom—homemade cookies! 🍪
- **THROB**: Another way your heart goes wild, especially after watching a rom-com. 💓
- **BAD**: Michael Jackson, anyone? 🎶 Or just something you don't wanna be called!
- **PREHEAT**: You always gotta preheat the oven. Don't be that person who forgets! 🔥
- **PASTOR**: Another person in the church scene but totally different vibe from the pope. 🙏

OMG, today’s puzzle was such a ride! 🚀 First off, the **heart-related** group totally threw me for a loop at first. I mean, the word **THROB**?! Not where I expected that to go. 💀 I was sitting there staring at it like, "Do I need a medical degree for this??" But once I started thinking about all the times my heart races (like when my phone’s at 1% 🔋), it clicked!

And okay, the **recipe verbs** were almost too easy. I mean, I bake ALL the time! Just call me Betty Crocker. 🍰😎 But it still made me crave cupcakes halfway through. Like, I legit paused to look up frosting recipes on Pinterest. 😋

The **boys** category was hilarious. I was like, “Is **Bad Boys** too obvious?” but hey, sometimes the obvious answers are the right ones! Plus, who can forget the **Hardy Boys**? Those mystery-solving kids were my jam back in the day. 🕵️‍♂️

The church titles... well, let’s just say I know way more about religious hierarchy now than I did before today. The **pope** and **pastor** made sense, but I had to Google the **prior** one. 🙈

See ya tomorrow for more puzzle madness! 💕👋

## What is Connections?

Connections is from The New York Times, and it's seriously so fun and addictive. Shoutout to Wyna Liu, one of the associate puzzle editors, for helping bring this gem to their Games section!

Here's how it works: every day, there's a new puzzle with 16 words, and the goal is to group these words into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like book titles, software, country names, you name it. But be careful‚Äîthere‚Äôs only one correct way to group them, even if multiple words seem like they fit together.

If you get a set right, those words disappear from the board. But if you guess wrong, it counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. The best part is that you can shuffle the board to help spot connections more easily, which is a total lifesaver sometimes!

Each group is color-coded based on difficulty: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like with Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media, which makes it even more fun.

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, so it's super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you'll be hooked! Happy puzzling!

So, today‚Äôs Connections puzzle was a blast! ü•≥ I tackled it with my bestie over our Sunday brunch. We always have a good laugh and a bit of competition to see who can solve it faster.

The **COOKING TACTICS** category made me think of all those times I‚Äôve almost burnt my dinner while trying to get that perfect **SEAR**. üòÖ I mean, who hasn‚Äôt tried to **CHAR** something and ended up with a kitchen full of smoke?

**LISTEN CLOSELY** was a tricky one! I was thinking of musical instruments at first, but then **HAMMER** and **ANVIL** made me realize we were talking about the ear. I totally had a "duh" moment. üòÇ

**BLACK BEAUTY** was my favorite because I‚Äôve always been a fan of deep, mysterious colors. **SABLE** and **JET** just sound so elegant, don‚Äôt they? It made me want to repaint my room in a dark, moody shade. üñ§

**THE DRIVER'S SEAT** had me thinking about all the places you might find someone in charge. Whether it's a **GOLF BAG** or a **LIMOUSINE**, there‚Äôs always someone behind the wheel, literally or figuratively. üöó

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck, remember to shuffle those words! It really helps to see them in a new order. And hey, no pressure‚Äîthis is all about having fun and keeping those brain cells sharp. You‚Äôve got this! üí™ü§ì

Until next time, happy puzzling! üß©‚ú®

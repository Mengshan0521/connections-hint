## Hey besties! 💁‍♀️  

It’s September 29, 2024, and today's *NYT Connections* had my brain doing some serious acrobatics. 🤸‍♀️ I swear, I was trying to figure out promises, bedding, and card games all at once. Seriously, my head was spinning faster than when I mix up my skincare routine because I forgot which serum goes first (relatable, right? 😂). Let’s break this one down together and figure it out like the queens (and kings) we are! 👑💪  

### Word Explanations 💬  

- **PLAY**: It’s game time! Whether you’re playing cards or playing with your friends’ emotions (kidding! 😜), it’s all about the fun! 🎲
- **JUSTICE**: Honestly, all I’m picturing is a superhero serving up justice or maybe that one time you totally called out someone for cutting in line at Starbucks. ☕✊  
- **THROW**: Like tossing that blanket over your couch after a Netflix binge, or maybe tossing shade. You know the vibe. 😏  
- **ENERGY**: What we all need after scrolling on TikTok for hours—give me all the caffeine or naps! ☕💤  
- **HONOR**: Promises, values, or maybe just remembering to honor those commitments…like actually going to the gym. 😅  
- **PASS**: Passing the ball, passing on a date, or just passing on responsibilities (I see you, procrastinators! 👀).  
- **KEEP**: Hold onto it tight, whether it’s your promise, that cozy blanket, or the last cookie in the jar. 🍪  
- **SHAM**: Ever bought something that looked good online but was a total sham in real life? Yeah, I feel that. 🙄💸  
- **DISCARD**: Like when you toss aside old habits or that one ex’s hoodie you’ve been holding onto (it's time, girl). 🧥👋  
- **SHEET**: From comfy bed sheets to a sheet of paper filled with ideas, this one’s all about covering your bases! 🛏️📝  
- **STATE**: Whether it’s the state of your room (hello, laundry pile!) or the state of your mind, we’re all in a certain "state." 🤯  
- **FULFILL**: That feeling when you finally fulfill a promise or your online order arrives on time (so rare, right? 😩).  
- **BLANKET**: A snuggly must-have for cold nights or lazy Sundays. Maybe even a blanket statement you casually throw out there! 😉  
- **LABOR**: Whether it's that grind at work or the labor of love for your passion projects, you know what’s up. 💼💖  
- **UPHOLD**: Keeping up those high standards or that moral code, even when it’s tough—like upholding a “no more snacks” rule (oops).  
- **DRAW**: Whether you’re pulling a card in a game or just drawing doodles in the margins of your notes, it’s all good. 🎨🃏  

### Theme Hints 🔍  

1. **Make Good on Promises**:  
   - Think of the promises you keep, honor, or uphold. Maybe it's the one you made to yourself about *finally* cleaning out that closet. 👗👠  
   
2. **All About Bedding**:  
   - It’s cozy time—things you find in your bedroom like sheets, blankets, or that one sham you bought but never actually use. 🛌💤  
   
3. **Actions in Card Games**:  
   - If you love game nights as much as I do, this group’s got all your fave card game moves—like drawing, playing, discarding, and passing. 🎴🎮  

4. **Cabinet Departments**:  
   - This one’s for all my political buffs (or those who *accidentally* memorized these for a high school test). We’re talking big government departments like Justice and State. 💼🌍

Phew, that was one crazy puzzle! 🤯 Who else was sitting there trying to figure out how justice fits with bedding? LOL, me too. Now that we’ve solved it, I think it’s time for some self-care, aka throwing a blanket over myself and watching something mindless. Catch you all tomorrow for the next round of brain busters! 🧠💥  

Love ya! 😘

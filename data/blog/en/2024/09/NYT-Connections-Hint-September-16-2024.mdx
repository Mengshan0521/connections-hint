## What’s New in Connections Today?

Hey, hey, hey! 👋 It’s September 16, 2024, and I’m back with my daily *NYT Connections* obsession (and probably yours, too!). Seriously, these puzzles are like a mental workout, and it’s kind of a thing now that I do over coffee each morning—along with a side of social media scrolling, of course ☕📱. Let’s crack today’s puzzle together! 🧩✨

## Word Explanations

- **CACTUS**: It’s that prickly desert plant we all try not to touch—unless you’re into that kind of thing 🌵😅.
- **BOTTLE**: You’ve got everything from fancy wine bottles to your reusable water bottle. Hydration is key! 💧🍾.
- **MUSHROOM**: The little fungi that somehow work in salads, pizza, and video games 🍕🍄.
- **CHEESE**: Gooey, melty, and the perfect comfort food. Or maybe you’re more of a “that’s cheesy!” person 🧀🤷‍♀️.
- **SUPREME**: Not just your pizza topping, but also meaning something totally next level 🔝✨.
- **GRADUATE**: Hats off! 🎓 Whether you’re thinking about a grad student or finally walking across that stage.
- **HEDGEHOG**: Small, spiky, and SO cute! And who could forget that fast blue video game icon? 🦔💨.
- **PINEAPPLE**: A tropical fruit and the center of the controversial "does it belong on pizza?" debate 🍍🍕.
- **CORN**: Corny jokes or corn on the cob at BBQs—either way, it’s a-maize-ing 🌽😂.
- **SALARY**: That thing we all chase to fund our coffee habits and weekend brunches 💸☕.
- **PAP**: Blah, boring stuff you don’t want to deal with. Just skip the mushy stuff 🙄.
- **PRINCIPAL**: The head honcho at school (and no, I don’t mean your enemy from high school) 🎓.
- **CHIEF**: The one in charge—whether we’re talking about the kitchen or the office 👨‍🍳👩‍💼.
- **MACE**: It’s either that medieval spiky weapon or the pepper spray you keep in your bag for safety reasons 🗡️👛.
- **PREMIER**: Think top-tier, number one, or maybe that fancy VIP section at the club 🏆✨.
- **MUSH**: Icky, overcooked food or an overly sentimental rom-com. Either way, a little goes a long way 🍚🥲.

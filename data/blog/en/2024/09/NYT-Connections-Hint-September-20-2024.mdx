## Good Morning, Puzzle Fam! 🌞

It’s September 20, 2024, and today’s *NYT Connections* game was full of familiar names, unexpected combos, and a lot of galaxy far, far away vibes ✨.

Whew, that was a ride! 🚀 I nearly lost it when I saw the *Star Wars* references (and don’t get me started on how *Chewy* threw me off). But once the "Kitty" group clicked, it was smooth sailing from there. 🏄‍♀️ Anyone else feeling like they need to cuddle their cat (or Wookie) after this one? 😂 Let me know how y’all did! I’m off to go find *my* corner with a book and a cup of tea ☕📖.

Catch you in the next one! 😘

## Hey besties! 💖

OMG, happy *October 11th*, everyone! Today’s *NYT Connections* was like one of those puzzles where you start all confident and end up second-guessing everything! 🤯 I was sitting here sipping on my pumpkin spice latte (basic, but you know what? IDGAF, it's delicious 🧡), and suddenly I found myself swimming in clues. Let’s break it down together, shall we? 🏊‍♀️✨

## Word Explanations

- **NERVE**: I was thinking either nerve endings (too sciencey? 😅) or someone having the *nerve* to do something bold. I need more nerve to finish all my fall shopping tbh! 🛍️
- **SPLASH**: Picture a pool day or a splash of something fun in your drink 🏖️🍹.
- **EXTRA**: Oh honey, I'm all about the extra—like when you’re just *that* dramatic ✨ (guilty!).
- **RELISH**: Not just the green stuff on hotdogs! It’s like fully enjoying something. I *relish* my alone time on the weekends 🧘‍♀️.
  
- **GRAVY**: Thanksgiving vibes, but also like that unexpected bonus you didn’t expect and *love*! 🦃.
- **TREASURE**: Something you hold close to your heart. My vintage jewelry collection? Total treasure 🪙💎.
- **SAUCE**: I mean, if you don’t have sauce, are you even living? Spicy, sweet, or just that vibe you bring to the table 😏.
- **DIP**: Pool or chips, it’s a must-have. Or like when you “dip out” from an awkward convo at a party 👋😬.

- **DIVE**: Deep dive into Netflix or dive into the ocean… both bring me peace TBH 🌊📺.
- **BONUS**: The cherry on top, the unexpected gift 🎁. Who doesn’t love a bonus?!
- **VALUE**: What do you *really* value in life? Friends? Family? Or just that cozy sweater you wear on repeat 😂?
- **BRASS**: You need brass to stand up for yourself—so much *bravery* in this word 💪.

- **FROSTING**: Cake’s best friend, and yeah, I definitely just ate it straight out of the can 🍰.
- **CHEEK**: Not just on your face, it’s all about sass. And girl, I’ve got plenty of cheeky moments! 😏
- **SWIM**: Channeling my inner mermaid here! Either you’re swimming or sinking 🌊🐠.
- **SAVOR**: The slow, sweet enjoyment of life’s little moments—like the last bite of dessert 😋.

1. **Cherish the Moment**  
   - Think of words about treasuring and savoring life! ✨💖.

2. **Splashing Into Fun**

3. **Unexpected Perks**  
   - Who doesn’t love a little *extra*? These are words about bonus benefits or sweet surprises 🎁.

4. **Bold Attitude**  
   - These words are all about confidence and being a bit *cheeky* or brash! 😎

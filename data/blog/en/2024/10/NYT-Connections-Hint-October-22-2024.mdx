## Heyyy, puzzle lovers! 😍

Okay, it's October 22nd, and if you’re like me, today’s NYT Connections puzzle probably had you jumping from designer handbags to NASA spacecraft and back again. Seriously, talk about taking me on a whirlwind tour of random knowledge! 🌪️ You know I’m here to spill all the tea and guide you through today’s game, so buckle up! 🚀✨  

### Word Explanations  

- **DESIGNER**: Oh, you mean like that Gucci bag I’ve been saving for? Same energy! 👛  
- **ENGINEER**: My high school friend who’s now solving the world's tech problems with *science* (ugh, so smart 🧠).  
- **HATCH**: Not the egg kind, but more like when you hatch a plan to avoid doing laundry! 😂  
- **TAG**: That playground game where you'd sprint for your life? Yeah, childhood throwback! 👧  

- **GALILEO**: The OG astronomer! 🌌 Not gonna lie, I kinda wish I could name-drop Galileo at parties.  
- **MARCO POLO**: The pool game! But also that explorer we all learned about in history class. 🏊‍♀️  
- **MASTERMIND**: Always feel like this when I solve the Connections before my friends... even if it takes me an hour 😅.  
- **VIKING**: Those cool, tough-as-nails explorers. Honestly, Viking shows give me serious wanderlust.  

- **BINGO**: A game I’m *weirdly* good at? Maybe because it involves yelling “BINGO!”—my fave part. 😄  
- **PIONEER**: Shout out to those who boldly went where no one had gone before... and also to my camping trips. 🏕️  
- **LUXURY**: My dream life... but also, my skincare routine when I’m feeling fancy. 😌💅  
- **CONCOCT**: What I try to do when I "make up" a recipe that doesn’t *quite* work out—still edible! 🍝  

- **HAUTE**: The *haute* couture life I can’t afford but love to pretend I’m part of. I mean, I can look, right? 💁‍♀️  
- **VOYAGER**: NASA’s badass space probe that’s literally *out* of this world. Goals! 🌍🚀  
- **UNO**: Family game night stress. There’s always that one person who drops the Draw Four and ruins lives! 😱  
- **HIGH-END**: Like that restaurant I saved up to go to last month. Totally worth it for the Insta pics! 📸  

### Theme Hints  

1. **Luxury Fashion Terms** 👗✨  
   - Think fancy and high-end fashion: DESIGNER, HAUTE, HIGH-END, LUXURY. This is the world I dream of, tbh!  

2. **Plan Makers** 🧠💡

3. **NASA Spacecraft** 🚀  
   - If you’re into space, these spacecraft should ring a bell: GALILEO, PIONEER, VIKING, VOYAGER. Where can I sign up for a trip?  

4. **Games Where You Say the Name** 🎲

## Hey besties! 💖

What’s up, friends? It’s *October 10th* and today's *NYT Connections* game had me spinning in circles trying to connect the dots! 🤯 I started my day with a cup of *TEA* (you'll see why that's funny in a sec) and dove right in. Did anyone else feel like this one was trickier than usual, or was that just me? Let’s walk through it together, and I’ll break down all those sneaky connections! 😎✨

## Word Explanations

- **HIP**: Not just your cool factor, but literally your hip! Think body parts, y’all 🦵.
- **TEA**: Yes, the drink ☕, but also... "spill the tea" much? 🫖 (we love gossip).
- **BIG**: One of my fave Tom Hanks movies! 🍿 Or just something, well, BIG.  
- **BAD**: In the ‘80s, this wasn’t bad-bad, it was BAD-meaning-good 😏.  

- **EYE**: 👁 What you’re using to read this right now, of course.
- **FLY**: Not just soaring in the sky—it's an old-school term for looking stylish! 🕶️.
- **SEW**: Something I wish I could do. Needle and thread magic 🧵.
- **SAW**: Either a horror movie or something you use in your garage! 🔪😱.

- **ILL**: “Yo, that’s so ill!” Translation: *That’s amazing!* 🧢 (throwback to the ‘80s slang).
- **FAR**: Far out, like “wow that’s really cool!” Or, you know, distance 🌍.
- **ELF**: Tiny, magical creatures, or maybe that Christmas movie we all watch too much 🎄.
- **LEG**: Walk the walk! (Another body part... are you catching on? 👀).

- **HER**: That sweet little movie with Joaquin Phoenix falling in love with an AI? 🤖❤️.
- **RAD**: Short for radical, aka awesome in ‘80s talk 🤘.
- **ARM**: Another body part... think of your arm flexing 💪.
- **DOE**: Not the money kind, but a deer, a female deer 🦌 (sound familiar from a certain song? 🎶).

1. **Body Parts**  
   - These are parts of the body you definitely use daily, even if you don’t think about it 💪👁️.

2. **Totally ‘80s Cool**  
   - These words were all the rage in the ‘80s. If you’ve ever rocked shoulder pads or neon, you know what I mean 😎.

3. **Movie Night Vibes**

4. **Do-Re-Mi**

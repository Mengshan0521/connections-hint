## Hey, hey, hey! 🙌  

Happy Monday, friends! 💖 It’s October 21st, and guess what? Today's NYT Connections puzzle took me on quite the wild ride—from the kitchen pantry to the driver’s seat and even to a pool (no swimming involved though 😅). I’m here to break it all down for you, so let’s jump in! 🏃‍♀️✨  

### Word Explanations  

- **WHIRL**: Like that dizzy feeling when I try to spin too fast during yoga... or when I think about my Monday to-do list! 🌀  
- **DRAW**: Something I do every morning—pulling eyeliner straight is an Olympic-level skill, IMO. 🎨  
- **NAVY**: Not just the shade of my favorite sweater, but also one of those "serious" colors that make me feel all official. 🧶💙  
- **LIVER**: Not a fan, to be honest (of the food, that is). I’m a pizza girl through and through. 🍕  

- **CAR**: My beloved four-wheeled freedom machine—can’t live without my road trip playlists! 🚗🎶  
- **KIDNEY**: Okay, okay, it’s a bean, but also something I really hope I never need surgery for! 😬 (Beans, though? Delicious.)  
- **HOOK**: What I use when I’m totally hooked on a Netflix show and can’t stop binge-watching (whoops). 📺😅  
- **DRIVE**: The mood I try to channel on a Monday morning (but also, where my car is most of the time). 🏎️  

- **PINTO**: This is my go-to when I want to spice up taco night. Bring on the beans! 🌮💃  
- **PULL**: The feeling I get when I open the fridge, realizing I have to cook. "Ugh, okay, fine!" 😜  
- **NEUTRAL**: My whole fall wardrobe aesthetic—greys, beiges, you name it. Cozy, comfy, and classy. 🍂👗  
- **DEAD**: Honestly, how I feel before my second cup of coffee hits. ☕💀  

- **LOW**: My car’s gear on steep hills—and my energy level before that coffee, tbh. 😴  
- **MUNG**: A bean I *think* I’ve seen at a health food store... Not sure how to cook it, though! 🫘  
- **GRAB**: What I do when I see the last slice of pizza—gotta be fast! 🍕😆  
- **REVERSE**: My favorite trick when I accidentally go the wrong way in a parking lot (which happens more than I’d like to admit). 🚘  

### Theme Hints  

1. **Kinds of Beans** 🌱  
   - Think of these as more than just ingredients for a chili cook-off: KIDNEY, MUNG, NAVY, PINTO. Let’s get cooking!  

2. **Attracting Actions** 😏  
   - All the ways to catch someone’s attention: DRAW, GRAB, HOOK, PULL. You know, like I try to get my cat’s attention when I shake the treat bag. 🐾💖  

3. **Automatic Gear Shifter Positions** 🚗  
   - It’s all about getting in the driver’s seat with these: DRIVE, LOW, NEUTRAL, REVERSE. Buckle up, friends!  

4. **___POOL** 🌀  
   - What do these have in common? CAR, DEAD, LIVER, WHIRL. Maybe not the kind of pool you want to swim in... 😬

## What is Connections?

Oh my gosh, you guys! Connections is this crazy addictive game from The New York Times that has become my daily brain workout. 🧠💪 Every morning, I dive into this 16-word puzzle and attempt to group them into four sets. It starts off easy, but by the time you hit the last group, you're totally second-guessing everything. You’ve only got four chances to mess up, so no pressure! 😅 It’s like doing a mental workout, but with more fun and less sweat. Once you’ve cracked it, you can’t help but share your results and boast about your brilliance. 😎✨

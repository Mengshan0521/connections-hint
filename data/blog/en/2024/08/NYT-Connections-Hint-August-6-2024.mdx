## What is Connections?

Connections is from The New York Times, and it's seriously so fun and addictive. Shoutout to Wyna Liu, one of the associate puzzle editors, for helping bring this gem to their Games section!

Here's how it works: every day, there's a new puzzle with 16 words, and the goal is to group these words into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like book titles, software, country names, you name it. But be careful‚Äîthere‚Äôs only one correct way to group them, even if multiple words seem like they fit together.

If you get a set right, those words disappear from the board. But if you guess wrong, it counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. The best part is that you can shuffle the board to help spot connections more easily, which is a total lifesaver sometimes!

Each group is color-coded based on difficulty: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like with Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media, which makes it even more fun.

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, so it's super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you'll be hooked! Happy puzzling!

Hey friends! üåü

Today‚Äôs Connections puzzle was a fun one! I played it while lounging in my backyard hammock, soaking up the sun. ‚òÄÔ∏è My cat, Mr. Whiskers, tried to help, but he‚Äôs better at batting at the screen than solving puzzles! üêæ

Starting with **FLUFFY WHITE THINGS** was a breeze. CLOUDS and SHEEP are my favorites‚Äîthere's nothing like lying on the grass, watching clouds go by, and pretending sheep are jumping over fences to help you nap! üò¥

The **ONE IN A RESEARCH STUDY** group took me back to my college days when I volunteered as a test subject for a psychology study. They said it was all about memory, but honestly, I think it was an excuse to see how many students would sign up for free pizza! üçï

**TAKE ISSUE** was a bit trickier. It made me laugh thinking about all the times I've OBJECTed to getting out of bed on a Monday. But once I figured out the theme, everything fell into place like magic! üé©‚ú®

Finally, **___HORN** was a real head-scratcher until I remembered the old foghorn sounds from my summer trip to the coast. üåä Then it clicked, and the rest was smooth sailing!

If you ever feel stuck, don‚Äôt forget the trusty shuffle button‚Äîit‚Äôs a total game changer! Keep puzzling, and remember, every wrong guess gets you closer to the right answer. You've got this! üí™ü§ì

Until next time, happy puzzling! üß©‚ú®

## What is Connections?

Connections is from The New York Times, and it's seriously so fun and addictive. Shoutout to Wyna Liu, one of the associate puzzle editors, for helping bring this gem to their Games section!

Here's how it works: every day, there's a new puzzle with 16 words, and the goal is to group these words into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like book titles, software, country names, you name it. But be careful—there’s only one correct way to group them, even if multiple words seem like they fit together.

If you get a set right, those words disappear from the board. But if you guess wrong, it counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. The best part is that you can shuffle the board to help spot connections more easily, which is a total lifesaver sometimes!

Each group is color-coded based on difficulty: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like with Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media, which makes it even more fun.

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, so it's super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you'll be hooked! Happy puzzling!

Hey friends! 🌟

Today’s Connections puzzle was a real brain teaser, but so much fun! My bestie and I tackled it over iced lattes at our favorite café. ☕✨ We started with the greeting cards category because we’ve been sending out so many birthday and thank you cards lately. 🎂💌

The **SURVIVE** group made us laugh because it reminded us of our college days, trying to "GET BY" with ramen noodles and all-nighters. **HACK IT**, **MAKE DO**, and **MANAGE** were our daily mantras back then! 😂

**ARE WE CLEAR?** was a bit tricky. We had a funny moment trying to use "CAPISCE" in a sentence without sounding like mobsters from a movie. But once we got it, everything clicked! 🤣

Finally, the **WORDS AFTER “EYE”** group was interesting. **CANDY** and **WITNESS** were easy picks, but **CONTACT** and **SHADOW** took a bit more thinking. We had to remember all those detective shows we binge-watch! 🕵️‍♀️

If you’re feeling stuck, don’t forget to shuffle the words. It really helps to see them in a different order! And remember, the goal is to have fun and keep your brain sharp. You got this! 💪🤓

Until next time, happy puzzling! 🧩✨

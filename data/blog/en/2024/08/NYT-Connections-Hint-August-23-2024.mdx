Hey there, lovely people! 🌟 Happy August 23, 2024! Today’s NYT Connections game had me smiling, scratching my head, and laughing all at once. If you're diving in, whether you’re cozied up on your couch or just killing time on your lunch break, I’ve got some juicy hints to help you sort out those tricky words. Let’s crack this together, shall we? 💪✨

## Word Explanations

- **TIE**:
  - Think of a necktie or what happens when two teams score the same. Or is it something you use to keep things together? 🤔
- **TAN**:
  - That golden-brown skin you get after a day in the sun. Or maybe a light brown shade? ☀️
- **FAN**:
  - Is it the thing that keeps you cool, or could it be a passionate supporter of something? 🎉
- **FAWN**:
  - A young deer, so cute! 🦌 Or perhaps a soft, light brown color? 💛
- **CHECK**:
  - Could be a pattern, something on your to-do list, or when you make sure something's right! ✅
- **FINISH**:
  - To complete something. Like a race, or even just the day’s work—feels good, doesn’t it? 🏁
- **MONITOR**:
  - The screen you’re probably reading this on, or maybe it’s about keeping an eye on something? 👀
- **BUFF**:
  - A shade of beige, or when someone’s been hitting the gym hard—buffed up! 💪
- **BOA**:
  - That fancy feathered thing you might wear to a costume party, or maybe a sneaky snake. 🐍
- **SCREEN**:
  - A display you watch movies on, or what you do to calls you don’t want to answer! 📺

  - Delicious in coffee or skincare, and of course, a lovely off-white color. ☕✨
- **BASK**:
  - What you do when you’re soaking up the sun or maybe just enjoying a moment of glory. 🌞
- **TERMINAL**:
  - The end of a journey, or where you catch a flight. ✈️
- **CORSET**:
  - An old-school, super tight, waist-cinching garment. Corsets and compliments, am I right? 💃
- **DISPLAY**:
  - To show off something proudly, like a new outfit or maybe just today’s puzzle results! 😎
- **GLOVES**:
  - Keep your hands cozy and warm or protect them when you’re doing something messy. 🧤

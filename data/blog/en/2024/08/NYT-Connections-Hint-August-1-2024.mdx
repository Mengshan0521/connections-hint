## What is Connections?

Connections is from The New York Times, and it's seriously so fun and addictive. Shoutout to Wyna Liu, one of the associate puzzle editors, for helping bring this gem to their Games section!

Here's how it works: every day, there's a new puzzle with 16 words, and the goal is to group these words into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like book titles, software, country names, you name it. But be careful‚Äîthere‚Äôs only one correct way to group them, even if multiple words seem like they fit together.

If you get a set right, those words disappear from the board. But if you guess wrong, it counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. The best part is that you can shuffle the board to help spot connections more easily, which is a total lifesaver sometimes!

Each group is color-coded based on difficulty: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like with Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media, which makes it even more fun.

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, so it's super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you'll be hooked! Happy puzzling!

Today's Connections puzzle was so fun! üòç I tackled it with my best friend over our morning coffee. We‚Äôve made this our little ritual, and it‚Äôs always a great start to the day. ‚òÄÔ∏è

The **PROMOTION TIME!** category had us thinking about all those times we‚Äôve had to sell something, whether it‚Äôs an idea at work or just hyping up a new movie we love. **HYPE** and **PITCH** were no-brainers. üí™

**TOSS IT!** was a fun one, especially since we just went to the beach last weekend and spent half the time playing catch. **FLING** and **CHUCK** brought back some hilarious memories of who could throw the farthest (spoiler: not me). üòÖ

**BOOK NOOK** made me think of my favorite bookstore downtown. I always get lost in the **ROMANCE** and **FICTION** sections, while my friend heads straight for **TRAVEL** and **HUMOR**. üìñ

And finally, **SOCK IT TO ME** made us laugh because we recently did a deep clean of our closets and found way too many **ANKLE** and **CREW** socks. üß¶

If you‚Äôre stuck, hit that shuffle button. Seeing the words in a new order really helps. And remember, the goal is to have fun and keep your brain sharp. You've got this! üí™ü§ì

Until next time, happy puzzling! üß©‚ú®

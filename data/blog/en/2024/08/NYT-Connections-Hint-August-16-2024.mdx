## What is Connections?

Hey there! 👋 Have you heard about Connections? It’s this brain-teasing game from The New York Times that has me totally hooked! 🤩 Every day, there’s a 16-word puzzle that you have to sort into four groups, and trust me, it’s like a little mental workout that leaves you feeling so accomplished (or slightly frustrated, but let’s not talk about that 😂). The challenge ramps up as you go, and by the end, you’re either feeling like a genius or questioning all your life choices. But honestly, it’s all in good fun, and once you figure it out, it’s so satisfying. 💪

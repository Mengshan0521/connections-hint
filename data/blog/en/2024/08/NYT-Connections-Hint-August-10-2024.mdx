## What is Connections?

Hey there, lovely people! 🌟 Have you ever tried Connections from The New York Times? It's like the ultimate brain teaser that gets you hooked instantly. Major props to Wyna Liu, one of the puzzle editors, for bringing this gem to life!

Here's the deal: every day, you're given 16 words, and your mission is to group them into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like types of fruit, famous movies, or even tech gadgets. But heads up—there's only one correct way to group them, so think carefully!

When you nail a set, those words vanish from the board. But guess wrong, and it counts as a mistake. You only get four mistakes before the game is over. Pro tip: shuffling the board can really help you spot connections you might have missed.

The difficulty levels are color-coded: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media. It's seriously addictive!

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, making it super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you won't be able to stop! Happy puzzling!

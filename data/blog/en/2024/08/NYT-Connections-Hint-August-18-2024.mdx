Happy Sunday, lovelies! ☀️ I woke up this morning with the sun shining through my window and my alarm clock blaring way too loudly (ugh, I’ll never get used to that sound). But as soon as I opened the NYT Connections puzzle for August 18, 2024, my day got a whole lot better! I mean, who wouldn’t smile at a mix of candy and dwarfs, right? 😂 Anyway, I’ve got some juicy hints for you, so let’s get into it!

- **NERD**:
  - That person (like me, lol) who’s into all the geeky stuff, from comics to coding. 🤓🎮
- **GRUMP**:
  - Imagine being in a bad mood all day long—yup, that’s a grump for ya! 😠
- **SNOOZE**:
  - The best button on your alarm clock when you just need “five more minutes.” 😴⏰

  - That little phrase we all use when we’re daydreaming or planning something wild. 🤔💭
- **SAY**:
  - Whether you’re speaking your mind or just casually chatting, this is what you do. 🗣️💬
- **DO**:
  - Action, baby! This word is all about getting things done. 🚀✨
- **DOPE**:
  - Slang for something that’s super cool or impressive (also what some people call me when I’m on point, lol). 😎🔥
- **RUNT**:
  - The tiniest one in a group, like that small fry in a litter of puppies. 🐶💛
- **SLEEP**:
  - The one thing we never seem to get enough of, but always crave. 🛏️💤
- **KISS**:
  - That sweet, romantic gesture, or just what you give your BFF on the cheek. 😘💋
- **SUPPOSE**:
  - Like “what if,” but a little more serious—maybe when you’re contemplating something big. 🤔🧐
- **ALARM**:
  - That noisy device that yanks you out of your dreams every morning. (Ugh, right?!) 🚨⏰
- **HOUR**:
  - Sixty minutes of time, or how long I spend trying to finish these puzzles. ⏳⏰
- **PERHAPS**:
  - A polite way to say maybe—like when you’re not quite sure but don’t want to commit. 🤷‍♀️💁‍♀️
- **TIME SET**:
  - That thing you do with your alarm clock before hitting the hay. 🕒⏰
- **WHOPPER**:
  - Either a big ol’ lie or a giant candy that’s surprisingly tasty. 🍬😋

## Theme Hints

1. **ALARM CLOCK BUTTONS**:
   - Think about what you press when you’re half-asleep and desperately trying to stop that annoying sound. 
2. **“HERE’S A THOUGHT ...”**:
   - Phrases we use when we’re brainstorming or suggesting something, usually with a hint of hesitation.
3. **CANDY PIECES**:
   - Tiny sweet treats that might remind you of Halloween or a trip to the candy store.

- **ALARM CLOCK BUTTONS**: ALARM, HOUR, SNOOZE, TIME SET
  - These are all the buttons you fumble with when you’re groggily trying to wake up in the morning. Honestly, the snooze button is my best friend! 😂
  
- **“HERE’S A THOUGHT ...”**: PERHAPS, SAY, SUPPOSE, WHAT IF
  - When you’re throwing ideas out there or just mulling something over, these words help you frame your thoughts. So relatable when you’re trying to figure out plans with friends! 🤔💡
  
- **CANDY PIECES**: KISS, NERD, RUNT, WHOPPER
  - These are all yummy treats you’d find in a candy aisle. Perfect for when you need a sweet pick-me-up! 🍬😋
  
- **SEVEN DWARFS MINUS LAST LETTER**: DO, DOPE, GRUMP, SLEEP
  - Take off the last letter of those beloved dwarfs’ names, and you’ve got yourself a tricky group. My fave here is Grump, because who doesn’t relate to that mood sometimes? 😜

And that’s a wrap on today’s puzzle, folks! 🎉 This one had a little bit of everything—from sweet treats to grumpy moods. I was definitely in my element with the candy (because, duh, who doesn’t love a good snack while puzzling?), but those dwarfs? They had me scratching my head for a minute! 😅

Anyway, I’m off to enjoy the rest of this beautiful day (maybe after a nap because, well, *SNOOZE*). If you’re still stuck, don’t sweat it—we’ll get through it together. Same time tomorrow? Let’s do it! 💖

Until then, keep those brains buzzing and your hearts full! 💕✨

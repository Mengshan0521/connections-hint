## What is Connections?

Connections is from The New York Times, and it's seriously so fun and addictive. Shoutout to Wyna Liu, one of the associate puzzle editors, for helping bring this gem to their Games section!

Here's how it works: every day, there's a new puzzle with 16 words, and the goal is to group these words into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like book titles, software, country names, you name it. But be careful‚Äîthere‚Äôs only one correct way to group them, even if multiple words seem like they fit together.

If you get a set right, those words disappear from the board. But if you guess wrong, it counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. The best part is that you can shuffle the board to help spot connections more easily, which is a total lifesaver sometimes!

Each group is color-coded based on difficulty: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like with Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media, which makes it even more fun.

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, so it's super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you'll be hooked! Happy puzzling!

Hey friends! üåü

Today‚Äôs Connections puzzle was a real brain teaser, but so much fun! I tackled it over a refreshing iced matcha latte at my favorite caf√©. üçµ‚ú®

The **NICKNAMES FOR THE SEA, WITH ‚ÄúTHE‚Äù** category was a breeze! I‚Äôm a total beach bum, so terms like **BLUE** and **BRINY** were second nature. üåä

The **BEGINNING WITH DOUBLE LETTERS** group had me scratching my head for a bit. But once I spotted **AARDVARK** and **LLAMA**, the rest fell into place. Double letters can be sneaky! üÖ∞Ô∏èüÖ∞Ô∏è

**KIDDO** was super fun! It reminded me of all the cute nicknames I have for my little cousins. **SPORT** and **TIGER** are what I call them when we‚Äôre playing outside. üêØ

Finally, the **UP FOR IT** group was all about that positive, can-do attitude. **AMENABLE** and **WILLING** are basically my life mottos! üòä

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck, don‚Äôt forget to shuffle the words. It really helps to see them in a different order! And remember, the goal is to have fun and keep your brain sharp. You got this! üí™ü§ì

Until next time, happy puzzling! üß©‚ú®

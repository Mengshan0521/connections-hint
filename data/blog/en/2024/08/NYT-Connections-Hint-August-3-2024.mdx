## What is Connections?

Connections is a super fun and addictive game from The New York Times. Big thanks to Wyna Liu, one of the associate puzzle editors, for bringing this gem to their Games section!

Here's the deal: every day, there's a new puzzle with 16 words, and the goal is to group these words into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like movie titles, types of food, or emotions. But watch out‚Äîthere‚Äôs only one correct way to group them, even if multiple words seem like they fit together.

If you nail a set, those words disappear from the board. But if you guess wrong, it counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. The best part is that you can shuffle the board to help spot connections more easily, which is a total lifesaver sometimes!

Each group is color-coded based on difficulty: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like with Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media, making it even more fun.

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, so it's super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you'll be hooked! Happy puzzling!

Hey friends! üåü

Today‚Äôs Connections puzzle was a real brain teaser, but so much fun! My bestie and I tackled it over iced lattes at our favorite caf√©. ‚òï‚ú® We started with the **A BIT OF EXCITEMENT** category because we both love that rush you get from thrill rides and adventures. **HIGH** and **THRILL** were easy picks since we‚Äôre always chasing that adrenaline rush! üé¢

The **TOLERATE** group made us laugh because we‚Äôve both been putting up with our noisy neighbors lately. **BEAR**, **STAND**, **STOMACH**, and **TAKE** felt like a perfect description of our patience levels! üòÇ

**NONSENSE** took us back to our school days when we used to call out each other's silly stories. **BALONEY** and **BULL** were no-brainers, but **BUNK** and **TRIPE** were a bit trickier until we remembered all those goofy phrases. ü§™

Finally, the **THINGS TO CLICK** group was fun to figure out. **MOUSE** and **REMOTE** were obvious, but **HEELS** and **TONGUE** made us giggle until we realized how they fit. üñ±Ô∏è

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck, don‚Äôt forget to shuffle the words. It really helps to see them in a different order! And remember, the goal is to have fun and keep your brain sharp. You got this! üí™ü§ì

Until next time, happy puzzling! üß©‚ú®

## What is Connections?

Connections is from The New York Times, and it's seriously so fun and addictive. Shoutout to Wyna Liu, one of the associate puzzle editors, for helping bring this gem to their Games section!

Here's how it works: every day, there's a new puzzle with 16 words, and the goal is to group these words into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like book titles, software, country names, you name it. But be careful—there’s only one correct way to group them, even if multiple words seem like they fit together.

If you get a set right, those words disappear from the board. But if you guess wrong, it counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. The best part is that you can shuffle the board to help spot connections more easily, which is a total lifesaver sometimes!

Each group is color-coded based on difficulty: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like with Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media, which makes it even more fun.

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, so it's super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you'll be hooked! Happy puzzling!

Hey friends! 🌟

Today’s Connections puzzle was a blast! I played it while sipping on my iced coffee, enjoying the summer vibes. ☀️ My cat, Luna, was lounging beside me, clearly uninterested in puzzles but very interested in my coffee. 🐾

Starting with **RESTAURANT JOBS** was a no-brainer. I used to work as a server during college, so those roles are ingrained in my brain! The restaurant life is tough but rewarding. 🍽️

The **CRAM** group made me think of packing for my last-minute weekend trip. You know how it is—shoving everything into your suitcase and hoping it zips! 🧳

**ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM** took me back to high school physics. I remember using a microwave to heat up leftover pizza while cramming for exams. Balancing science and snacks! 🍕📡

**THINGS WITH BITS** was a bit tricky, but then I thought about my love for stand-up comedy. Comedians definitely have bits, and so do bytes in my computer! 😂💻

If you ever get stuck, remember to shuffle the board. It’s like shaking up your brain to see things differently. Keep puzzling, and don’t forget to share your results with friends! You’ve got this! 💪🤓

Until next time, happy puzzling! 🧩✨

## What is Connections?

Connections is from The New York Times, and it's seriously so fun and addictive. Shoutout to Wyna Liu, one of the associate puzzle editors, for helping bring this gem to their Games section!

Here's how it works: every day, there's a new puzzle with 16 words, and the goal is to group these words into four categories. Each category has four words that share something in common, like book titles, software, country names, you name it. But be careful‚Äîthere‚Äôs only one correct way to group them, even if multiple words seem like they fit together.

If you get a set right, those words disappear from the board. But if you guess wrong, it counts as a mistake, and you only get four mistakes before the game ends. The best part is that you can shuffle the board to help spot connections more easily, which is a total lifesaver sometimes!

Each group is color-coded based on difficulty: yellow is the easiest, then green, blue, and purple. And just like with Wordle, you can share your results with friends on social media, which makes it even more fun.

You can play Connections on your web browser or on your phone, so it's super convenient. Trust me, once you start, you'll be hooked! Happy puzzling!

Hey friends! üåü

Today‚Äôs Connections puzzle was a real brain teaser, but so much fun! My bestie and I tackled it over iced lattes at our favorite caf√©. ‚òï‚ú® We started with the DJ category because we‚Äôve been obsessed with remix playlists lately. **MIX** and **SPIN** were easy picks since we‚Äôve been pretending to be DJs at every party this summer. üéâ

The **STRETCH, AS ONE‚ÄôS PATIENCE** group made us giggle because it reminded me of my recent attempts to assemble IKEA furniture. **STRAIN**, **TAX**, **TEST**, and **TRY** felt like a perfect description of that ordeal! üòÇ

**ADJECTIVES USED IN GRAMMAR** took us back to our school days. We had a little debate over **DIRECT** and **PRESENT**, but once we figured it out, it felt like a mini grammar lesson. üìù

Finally, the **WHAT ‚ÄúGREEN‚Äù MIGHT MEAN** group was interesting. **ECOLOGICAL** was a given since we‚Äôre both passionate about the environment. But **JEALOUS** and **NAUSEOUS** were tricky until we remembered the phrases ‚Äúgreen with envy‚Äù and ‚Äúgreen around the gills.‚Äù üå±

If you‚Äôre feeling stuck, don‚Äôt forget to shuffle the words. It really helps to see them in a different order! And remember, the goal is to have fun and keep your brain sharp. You got this! üí™ü§ì

Until next time, happy puzzling! üß©‚ú®
